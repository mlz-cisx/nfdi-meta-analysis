A data management plan or DMP is a formal document that outlines how data are to be handled both during a research project, and after the project is completed. The goal of a data management plan is to consider the many aspects of data management, metadata generation, data preservation, and analysis before the project begins, this may lead to data being well-managed in the present, and prepared for preservation in the future.

ARGOS is the joint effort of OpenAIRE and EUDAT to deliver an open platform for Data Management Planning that addresses FAIR and Open best practices and assumes no barriers for its use and adoption.

It is an open extensible service - available as a standalone service (OpenDMP) and as a OpenAIRE service (ARGOS) - that simplifies the management, validation, monitoring and maintenance of Data Management Plans. It allows actors (researchers, managers, supervisors etc) to create actionable DMPs that may be freely exchanged among infrastructures for carrying out specific aspects of the Data management process in accordance with the intentions and commitment of Data owners.

There are a number of templates within the tool that represent the requirements of different funders and institutions. Users are asked three questions at the outset so we can determine the appropriate template to display (e.g. the ESRC template when applying for an ESRC grant). Guidance is provided to help you interpret and answer the questions. This guidance is provided by researcher funders, universities and disciplines.
