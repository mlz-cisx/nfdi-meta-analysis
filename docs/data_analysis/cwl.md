Common Workflow Language (CWL) is an open standard for describing how to run command line tools and connect them to create workflows.

Tools and workflows described using CWL are portable across a variety of platforms that support the CWL standards. Using CWL, it easy to scale complex data analysis and machine learning workflows from a single developer's laptop up to massively parallel cluster, cloud and high performance computing environments.
