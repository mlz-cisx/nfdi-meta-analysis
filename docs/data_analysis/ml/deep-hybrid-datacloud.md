## Objectives
The final goal of the project is to prepare a new generation of e-infrastructures that harness latest generation technologies, supporting deep learning and other intensive computing techniques to exploit very large data sources. The project will provide the corresponding services to lower the adoption barriers for new communities and users, satisfying the needs of both research, education  communities and citizen science.
*(Software to deploy the service yourself is provided)*

Evolve, up to production level, intensive computing services exploiting specialized hardware components, like GPUs, low-latency interconnects, and others usually accessed as “bare metal” resources. The services, based on open source software, will follow existing standards to guarantee their deployment and orchestration on different platforms.

Integrate the intensive computing services under a Hybrid Cloud approach, assuring interoperability with the existing EOSC platforms and their services.


## Platform
A comprehensive platform for machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence in the European Open Science Cloud for developing, training, sharing and deploying your model.
