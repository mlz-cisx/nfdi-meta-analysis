# Galaxy Project
##### tags: `#TA2` `#TA3`

[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/use/) is an open-source platform for FAIR data analysis that enables users to:

- Use **tools** from various domains (that can be plugged into **workflows**) through its graphical web interface.
- Run code in **interactive environments** (RStudio, Jupyter...) along with other tools or workflows.
- **Manage data** by sharing and publishing results, workflows, and visualizations.
- **Ensure reproducibility** by capturing the necessary information to repeat and understand data analyses.

The **Galaxy Community** is actively involved in helping the ecosystem improve and sharing scientific discoveries.

# Galaxy - Pulsar

[Pulsar](https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar) is a Python server application that allows a [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) server to run jobs on **remote systems** (including Windows) *without requiring a shared mounted file systems*. Unlike traditional Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.

Full documentation for the project can be found on [Read The Docs](https://pulsar.readthedocs.io/).

# Questions

How would be load in our data, where and how many servers would we run and how would we achive that the workflow is processed, where the data lies?
