# ExPaNDS
European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) Photon and Neutron Data Service (ExPaNDS)

- Enable EOSC services and to provide coherent FAIR data services to the scientific users of national Photon and Neutron sources
- Connect national PaN RIs through a platform of data analysis as a service for users from research institutes universities, industry etc.
- Develop and maintain a catalogue of data and analysis software for Photon and Neutron data
- Gather feedback and cooperate with the EOSC governance bodies to improve the EOSC and develop standard relationships between scientific publications, Photon and Neutron scientific dataset (raw data), experimental reports, instruments and authors (via ORCID) 

This project will standardise and link all relevant catalogues to ensure that any scientific research communities have access to both the raw data collected that is linked to their session(s) at these facilities, and the relevant peer review articles produced as a direct result of their usage.

In order to do this, ExPaNDS will develop a common ontology for all the elements of these catalogues, a roadmap for the back-end architecture and functionalities (including APIs) and a powerful taxonomy strategy in line with the requirement of the EOSC user community.

## WP2: Enabling FAIR data for PaN national RIs  #TA1
Will extend and deepen the adoption and use of FAIR data principles within the Photon and Neutron community to allow publication and access of national RI data and services within the EOSC.

## Deliverables
- https://zenodo.org/record/5205825#.YdsihP7P1PY - Data policy framework
- https://zenodo.org/record/5636096#.YdsiD_7P1PY - FAIR data management


## WP3: EOSC data catalogue services for PaN national RIs
Will deliver EOSC data catalogue services for RIs to provide access as a one-stop-shop for scientific facility users, academics and the general public to find and exploit research data.

## Deliverables
- https://zenodo.org/record/4806026#.Ydsi9f7P1PY - ExPaNDS ontologies  #TA1
- https://zenodo.org/record/6363591#.Yq9olHbMJPY - ICat & SciCat with APIs compatible with ExPaNDS federated EOSC service  #TA2
- https://zenodo.org/record/6390324#.Yq9ornbMJPY - Portfolio material to support training for target groups at all Research Infrastructures  #TA4


## WP4: EOSC data analysis services for PaN national RIs  #TA2 #TA3
Will provide the coordination, adaption, and alignment of existing data analysis services at national RIs within the EOSC. The services delivered will provide users, academics and the public with the ability to run analysis workflows against the EOSC-aligned data services.

## Deliverables
- https://zenodo.org/record/4569421#.YGHwmq9KhPY - Guidelines for implementing the analysis services
- https://zenodo.org/record/4558708#.YFJ3A537SUk - Photon and Neutron reference data sets
- https://zenodo.org/record/5718671#.Ydsh5f7P1PY - Testing and Validation Framework
- https://zenodo.org/record/6305000#.Yq9oZXbMJPY - Analysis Services


## WP5: Training activities through EOSC platforms  #TA4
Will organise workshops and deliver training materials through the e-learning platforms made available on the EOSC. Training will be organised in cooperation with EOSC related activities.

Training will address:
- Service provision
- User training in FAIR principles
- Data stewardship
- Data management
- Data analysis services integrated into the EOSC 

The training will foster faster adoption of best practices by an enlarged number of scientific users.

## Deliverables
- https://zenodo.org/record/5171766#.YdsiZ_7P1PY - Demonstrator for using e-learning platforms


## WP6: Dissemination and Outreach
Will support and promote the ExPaNDS initiative in Europe and beyond and promote Open Data and FAIR data principles to users and other RIs around the world.
