The SECoP (**S**ample **E**nvironment **Co**mmunication **P**rotocol) is an Inclusive, Simple and Self Explaining (ISSE) communication protocol.

Inclusive means, that facilities can use this protocol and donâ€™t have to change their work flow (rewrite drivers completely or organize and handle hardware in a specific way to fulfill SECoP requirements).

Simple means it should be easy to integrate and to use.

Self Explaining means that with SECoP, not only the pure data is transported. It also transports meta data, which allows environment control software to configure by itself.

The benefit of SECoP will be to circulate expensive devices between different facilities with minimised effort for configuration and integration. This should result in an increased utilisation of expensive equipment.
