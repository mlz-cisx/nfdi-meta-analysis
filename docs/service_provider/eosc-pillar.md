The project aims to support the coordination and harmonization of national initiatives relevant to EOSC in Europe and investigate the option for them to interfederate at a later stage, help integrating initiatives and data/cloud providers through the development of common policies and tools, and facilitate user communities in adopting and using these services and propose new ones born from their scientific domain.


## FAIR Data Services

* Develop an innovative set of services for a Federated FAIR Data Space (F2DS), starting from the content of existing research data repositories.
* Set up support and training activities, facilitating the dissemination and adoption of FAIR standards for research data management.
* Boost, collate and agglomerate domain-specific ontologies and related metadata as the main basis for cross-domain interoperability.


## Federated FAIR Data Space (F2DS)

The F2DS is a unifying data space that is built by aggregating and enriching datasets from a set of multidisciplinary repositories, i.e. data sources, with the aim to facilitate data discovery and re-use. Although datasets are the primary focus of the resulting data space, other items are managed including repositories and data sources, APIs, metadata schemas and ontologies.


### Future steps for the F2DS

In the current version of the tool set, the focus has been set on the metadata harvesting and the DCAT mapping in order to publish the metadata to the FDP. The metadata enricher should be added in a later version of the service bundle and should be built leveraging the work of T5.5, e.g. using the FAIRifier service which allows metadata enrichment with ontologies if it is confirmed that it is still the tool of choice.

During the remaining of the project, a study will be carried out to evaluate the feasibility of the integration of F-UJI, an automated tool developed as part of the FAIRsFAIR project which allows a programmatic assessment of the FAIRness of research datasets, and the  connection of the FDP graph database with the FAIR Digital Object Framework (FDO-F) . Based on the outcome of this analysis, the decision could be made to implement these new features.
