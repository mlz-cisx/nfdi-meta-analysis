- So to say a gateway/hub to search for all the data
- Looks good
- Question: Can it support the selection of multiple datasets and redirection to an analysis platform?

### OpenAIRE ScholeXplorer
**Graph for plubications-data and data-data links**
Scholexplorer populates and provides access to a graph of links between dataset and literature objects and dataset and dataset objects.

The graph is openly accessible (CC-0) via [search REST APIs](https://scholexplorer.openaire.eu/api.scholexplorer.openaire.eu/v1/ui) that return links in [Scholix format](http://www.scholix.org/).
