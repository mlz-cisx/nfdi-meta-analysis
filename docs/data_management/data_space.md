The term ‘data space’ refers to a type of data relationship between trusted partners who adhere to the same high level standards and guidelines in relation to data storage and sharing.

A critical aspect of the data space notion is that data are not stored centrally, but rather at the source. Thus, they are only transferred through semantic interoperability as necessary.

A data space is the sum of all its participants, which may be data providers, users and intermediaries. Data spaces can be nested and overlapping. For instance, a data provider can participate in several data spaces all at once.
